	The purpose of this web page is to collect data from web browsers, which
	will be used in our Master's Thesis project. The goal of the project is
	to develop a method for determining the uniqueness of browsers, without
	using intrusive methods such as cookies. We will attempt to do this by
	looking at information about your browser, such as screen resolution,
	installed fonts, browser version, etc. This information constitutes
	your <i>browser fingerprint</i>. Find out more about the project and us
	by clicking the <span class="blue">About</span> button.
      </p>
      <p>
	We would greatly appreciate if you would take the time to share your
	data with us by clicking the <span class="green">Submit</span> button
	below. If you're interested in what type of data we're interested in,
	you can see your <i>fingerprint</i> by clicking
	the <span class="orange">Preview</span> button.
      </p>
      <p>
	Upon clicking <span class="green">Submit</span>, you agree to sharing
	your <i>fingerprint</i> with us and letting us store it for research
	purposes. We will be VERY careful with your data, and under no
	circumstances share it with others.
