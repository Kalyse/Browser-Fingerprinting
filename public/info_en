    This webpage is part of a Master's Thesis project, with the purpose of 
    collecting data from web browsers. The goal of the project is
    to develop a method for determining the uniqueness of browsers, without
    using intrusive methods such as cookies. We will attempt to do this by
    looking at information about your browser, such as screen resolution,
    installed fonts, browser version, etc. This information constitutes
    your <i>browser fingerprint</i>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We would greatly appreciate if you would take the time to share your data with
    us by clicking the <span class="blue">Share</span> button. The data
    collected from your browser will be displayed, and it will be removed from our
    server when the project is complete (April 2012). One of the values we collect
    is called <i>Uid</i>, which is a random id that is set as a cookie to be used
    when developing our uniqueness method.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon clicking <span class="blue">Share</span>, you agree to sharing
    your <i>fingerprint</i> with us and letting us store it for research
    purposes in out thesis work. No data will, under any circumstances, 
    be used for commercial purposes nor shared with others.
